# GANspection
#### *A semi-supervised one-class anomaly detection method based on a generative adversariel network structure*
##### (Work-in-progress)

Anomaly detection on images is a fundamental computer vision task and are of great interest in an industrial production setting, where products have to be quality assured and the magnitude of the production does not allow for human supervision. In recent years deep learning has improved performance in this field and research have been done on a variety of network structures and mathods to determine an anomaly. 

in this project, i will focus on generative models and will use a structure that resembles a GAN. Inspiration for models aswell as anomaly scores comes from a seres of papers (LINK LINK LINK)

## The Data: MVTec AD
[MVTec AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad) is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial inspection. It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and texture categories. Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects.

## The Model: BiGAN/ALI
